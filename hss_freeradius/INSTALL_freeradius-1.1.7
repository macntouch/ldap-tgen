The installation works only on VMWARE since some libraries are lacking.
On /local partition, execute:

./configure --prefix=/local/colin6/FREERADIUS

make
make install

/local/colin6/FREERADIUS is the directory where is installed the product.

/hss_freeradius/freeradius-1.1.7 is a copy of that directory.

I have also added the libraries necessary for execution, which are not in every
station in /hss_freeradius/freeradius-1.1.7/otherLibs.

A command for using the freeradius server is 
/hss_freeradius/freeradius-1.1.7/sbin/radiusd -d/mds_tests/mas/UnitaryTesting/Proxy/AccessRequest/raddb -X -A
if logs are on
and 
/hss_freeradius/freeradius-1.1.7/sbin/radiusd -d/mds_tests/mas/UnitaryTesting/Proxy/AccessRequest/raddb
without logs.
