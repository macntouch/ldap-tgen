# This file, with the same syntax as "users", can be used to modify the
# handling of accounting packets. For example, to ensure that a second
# RADIUS server gets a copy of all accounting packets from a certain NAS:

#DEFAULT NAS-IP-Address == 10.0.0.1, Replicate-To-Realm := "realmname"

# where 10.0.0.1 is the NAS in question and "realmname" is defined in the
# realms file to point to the second RADIUS server. If you don't want
# "username@realmname" to be accepted and replicated to the other server,
# label that realm with the "notsuffix" option in the realms file.
